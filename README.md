# WinAFRED
Project Description
WinAFRED :
**Win**dows **A**dd *F*ile Read Edit Delete Tester, is an application suite with the task of ensuring that virtual File systems work within a windows environment (Client and Server).
Written in C# and will use PInvokes to drive some tests.
What is this ?

There is a need to have a set of tests, that can be performed against Virtual / Filter / Loaded disk / CallBack / Cloud / USB / etc. based file systems, to show if the implementation is compliant.
These do not have to be hosted (Served) on a windows File system, but must be accessible from the windows client environment.
This tester is the starting point of these tests.
Aims

    To start easy,
    Add performance counters
    Add multi-threading
    Add asynchronous tests
    Add edge cases
    Wrap it in a nice GUI for everyone to use 

When will this happen ?

very soon :-
